Since childhood, I have been drawn to photography, perhaps it was because my grandfather was also into photography and at home he had an old film camera and a printing laboratory.</p>                            <p>So my journey into photography began as a childhood dream, but it took a profound turn when I experienced an episode teetering on the edge of life and death. This pivotal moment prompted me to realize my passion for creating art, recognizing that I have only one life to fulfill this calling.</p>                            <p>I am a dreamer and a romantic, and I like to convey the feeling of unreality in my photography; the fragile feeling of magic in the frame is important to me. I like it to feel like a dream.</p>                            <p>My photography is about life in imaginary worlds. Angels and mermaids exist there, whatever you want can be there. I am fascinated by the connection between nature and people, and I feel a fragile calm in this connection.</p>                            <p><strong>Mermaids Project</strong> captures the ethereal beauty of mysterious underwater worlds, bringing to life the mesmerizing world of mythical sea creatures. Invites viewers on a visual journey, exploring the boundaries between dreams and reality.</p>                            <p>And this year in winter, when I was haunted by dark emotions, I found in them inspiration for a new project, <strong>Flora incognita</strong>. My immersion in the search for otherworldly flowers from the world of dreams. Partly this is my self-portrait, partly itâ€™s my view of the world and my dreams. This is my personal feeling, unrequited love and drama are hidden there, my story is there. And everything is blurred by the unreality of reality.</p>                            <p>As a result, I can say that photography is my life, my path, and my way to be friends with our world! Through it, I connect with a sense of harmony.</p>                        </div>                    </div>                </div>            </div>            <div class="exhibitions">                <div class='container'>                    <div class="exhibitions__title">                        <h1>Participated in exhibitions:</h1>                    </div>                    <div class="exhibitions__body">                        <ul class="exhibitions__items">                            <li class="exhibitions__item">LoosenArt Gallery in Rome - "Freedom for free" 2021</li>                            <li class="exhibitions__item">LoosenArt Gallery in Rome - "IT'S MAGIC.
